# Python-Pokedex

Pokemon is a popular game consisting of many different monster species called "Pokemon."
In this application I have created a GUI in Python that compiles and displays images of these Pokemon.
First the user will enter either the name of the Pokemon they would like to see or they could enter in the "ID" number associated with the pokemon.
Then the application will retrieve the image from PyPokedex library and display it for the users to see.
